        <p>Have you ever wanted to fly? It is certainly possible to take a ride in an aircraft, but to get an unobstructed and first person view is unfortunately impossible. However, with the emergence of non-military unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it may be possible to finally simulate the freedom of unrestricted flight. </p>
        <p>Drones provide an excellent opportunity for equipment with advanced technological systems, including First Person View technology, abbreviated as FPV. This involves the outfitting of drones with high-quality cameras, broadcasting live video to the pilot. This enables the pilot to immerse themselves a surreal flying experience, giving them a view of the stunning vistas which can be observed in air, and allowing them to maneuver as they please. Consequently, the drones are able to fly through forests, and in smaller areas more efficiently. A gushing waterfall, a vibrant sunset over the ocean, and the depths of a deep gorge or canyon are all experiences available through FPV technology. </p>
        <p>Now, if you think that the only use of FPV technology’s application is for sightseeing, you’d be mistaken. The creative and slightly eccentric members of the civilian drone community have created a new sport, FPV drone racing. In this thrilling sport, UAV users race each other through challenging courses in the first person, described a combination of flying and RC car racing. It has gained massive popularity in the United Kingdom and in California, where some enthusiasts have even created leagues in which they stand in a row, viewing  and controlling through virtual-reality headsets. Yes, it may be an exclusive sport available only to those who can spare a small fortune for racing-quality drones, but is gaining massive worldwide attention and following.</p>
        <p>Overall, FPV drone technology is an exciting and lucrative sector of civilian drone application. Its revolutionary impacts not only in pleasure and sport, but in aerial cinematography and photography will mean that drones will shed their reputation of being spying, militaristic tools to being recognized for their entertaining and exciting nature.</p>
